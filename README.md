Betting game on Ethereum using Oraclize+random.org for trusted randomness

# Approaches

Two common approaches for trusted randomness are:
1. hash chain, like bustabit
2. trusted random data source, like random.org + oracle service, like oraclize

For our first iteration, we're going with 2 as it'll allow us to prototype something relatively rapidly. The
sooner we launch a game, the better :).
